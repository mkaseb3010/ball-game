This is a ball game that is designed to move depending on your phone movements. To move the ball
you need to rotate/tilt the phone to where you want the ball to move. You will be provided
with a bunch of input options to create your own game setup and goals, you can choose your order
of control, gain speed, map type and width, and the number of laps. 

The goal of the game is simple, you need to keep the ball in between the diameteres of the map and
complete the game being as accurate as you can.

**Usage:**
This program is coded with android studio, in the case of any compatibilty issues you may face running
the program, I am running gradle version 8.7 for this program.

Ensure these are the respectable agp versions you are running on android studio:
        agp_version = '7.2.2'
        agp_version1 = '8.5.0'

The tagretsdkversion for this program is 27, but any version higher than 13 will compile with this program
(preferred to use the latest version).

You can use an android phone or emulator to run this game.
